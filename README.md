# Confucius [![Build Status][badge]][build]

A Clojure library for composable and declarative configuration.

*NOTE* This is pre-alpha software. Expect bugs and frequent api changes!

Suggestions on api, bugfixes, feature request, etc are all very welcome!


# Rationale

Although zero configuration whould be awesome, in most cases it is not possible (sometimes
it is though: [elasticsearch][elasticsearch]). Application that require configuration
should be configurable through the environment they live in (see [12factor][12factor]).
Unfortunately this is not always easy as it may clutter your application with `(Sytem/getenv)`
calls that return data that is not typed. Also it makes it impossible to put all your
configuration in one place so that it is easily readable  or even to provide
sensible default values. Further, adding configuration to version control is awesome too.
Finally configuration should also be passed as parameters to program invocation.

`confucius` aims at solving exactly these problems. It builds on some of the ideas from
other libraries such as [immuconf][immuconf] (composability), [nomad][nomad],
or [environ][environ].


# Quick Start

The following clojure code will, given the configuration files
`awesome-service.yml`, `host.edn`, `subsys.json` (file contents
listed further down), yield

```clojure
(ns my.amazing.ns
 (:require
  [confucius.core  :as c]

  ;; If you want support for json and/or yaml you'll need to add
  ;; clojure.data.json or snakeyaml (or both) to your dependencies.
  ;;[confucius.ext.yaml]
  ;;[confucius.ext.json]
  [confucius.ext.all] ; this requires both

  [clojure.java.io :as io]))

(c/load-config
 ;; Why not calling prismatic's schema for validation & complex
 ;; coercion in postprocess?
 {:postprocess-fn identity} ; optional
 [{:global {:tmp-dir "${tmp.dir:/tmp}"}}
  (io/resource "awesome-service.yml")
  "host.edn"])

;; => {:global
;;      {:tmp-dir "/tmp"}
;;
;;     :http
;;      {:bind-address "0.0.0.0"
;;       :port 8080}
;;
;;      :audit-log-dir
;;      "/var/log/service/audit"  ;; assuming ${log-dir} was set to
;;                                ;; `/var/log` in the native environment
;;
;;      :subsys
;;      {:id "subsys1"}}
```

File contents:

```yaml
# file: awesome-service.yml (on classpath)
http:
  bind-address: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 80

# Include configuration from `sub-system.json`.
# Supports relative file urls.
subsys: "@:file://./subsys.json"

# Reference (in that order) either
# another value in the configuration,
# a java system property or the native
# enrivonment
audit-log: "${log-dir}/service/audit"
```

```json
# file: subsys.json (file system)
{ "id" : "subsys1" }
```

```edn
# file: host.edn
{:http {:port 8080}}
```

# Documentation

TODO


## Extending

TODO

`confucius.proto/ValueReader`

`confucius.proto/ConfigSource`

`confucius.proto/from-url`

# TODO

* support printing of configuration map
* integration with `tools.cli`? -> overwriting on the command line
* example integration with ``prismatic/schema`
* warn/log when config properties are being overwritten by
  other files. use metadata to show where the value came from?
